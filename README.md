# Travel-Management-with-QT-tool-Studio-and-SQL-Database
# Description:
In this project, I designed a tour management system using QT tool studio and utilized an SQLite database for data storage, the system includes the following main features:
- Customer Management: the functionality allows users to store basic information such as name, age, customer ID, mobile number,... and allows users to review customer information.
- Caps Management: users can select the type of vehicle based on price and travel distance.
- Bookings Management: users can choose the desired hotel and different quality packages.
- Charge and Bill: users can view the total cost for all the above services.
# How to use
- Download QT tool Studio 
- Download SQLite Database
- You must change the file path for 'TourManagement.db' in the "mainwindow.cpp" file so that the system knows where to save the database file.
