# Travel-Management-with-QT-tool-Studio-and-SQL-Database
#Description:
In this project, I designed a tour management system using QT tool studio and utilized an SQLite database for data storage. The system includes the following main features:
1.Customer Management
- The functionality allows users to store basic information such as name, age, customer ID, mobile number,...
- Allows users to review customer information
2.Caps Management
- Users can select the type of vehicle based on price and travel distance.
3.Bookings Management
- Users can choose the desired hotel and different quality packages.
4.Charge and Bill
-Users can view the total cost for all the above services.
#How to use
- Download QT tool Studio 
- Download SQLite Database
- You must change the file path for 'TourManagement.db' in the "mainwindow.cpp" file so that the system knows where to save the database file.
